-----------Warning-------------
Do not use src/main/webapp folder ever if you're packaging your applications as a JAR. 
Although src/main/webapp  is a standard Maven Directory, but it only works with WAR packaging.
Most of the Build Tools silently ignore src/main/webapp  directory in case of JAR packaging.
